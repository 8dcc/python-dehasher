Uses ```https://md5decrypt.net/en/Api/``` to dehash MD5 hashes. If the .txt hash list is > than 400 lines, it uses hashcat.

### Description
At the moment, only single hash mode is available. Multiple hash version (.txt) coming soon.

I upload the "original" file too, but the ```-h``` and ```-e``` modes do not work very well.

### Installation
``` git clone https://github.com/r4v10l1/python_dehasher``` 

``` cd python_dehasher``` 

``` python3 <desired_file>``` to see usage.
